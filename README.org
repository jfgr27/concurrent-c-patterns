* Concurrent C Patterns

A currated list of C concurrency patterns.

Please refer to the comments at the top of each file for details on each pattern.


Patterns include:

1. `pthreads.c`: basic threading using `<pthread.h>` library.
2. `join.c`: basic joining of threads to control threads completion before carrying on.
3. `mutex.c`: basic program preventing/causing a race condition when mutex is/not applied.


** Running
#+begin_src bash
  # builds corresponding pattern
  make run SCRIPT=name-of-script-without-extension

  # builds and runs corresponding pattern
  make run SCRIPT=name-of-script-without-extension
#+end_src
